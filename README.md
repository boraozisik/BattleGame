### BattleGame
**I made a battle game that playing with two people.**
# How to play:
*First of all, each player has his own tower.At the beginning, each player is creating his deck with 5 warriors.The warriors in these decks are fighting with each other.
If one player has no more warrior in his deck, enemy player can attack his tower and when a player's tower is destroyed this player loses the game.*
